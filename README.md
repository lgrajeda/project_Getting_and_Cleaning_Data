##Getting and Cleaning Data
##Data Science Specialization

This repo has three main components:

1.	run_analysis: this is the R_script I used to clean the data and to build the new data set

2.	summary mean and std from UCI HAR Dataset: this is the new dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3.	CodeBook: this is a file giving a description of each variable, the source of the original data and all the process performed to tide and create the new dataset.
